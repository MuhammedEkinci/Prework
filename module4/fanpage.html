            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <!--The bio section of page-->
            <p>Aerosmith is an American rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. The group consists of Steven Tyler (lead vocals), Joe Perry (guitar, vocals), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums) and Brad Whitford (guitar). 
                Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop rock, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. 
                They are sometimes referred to as "the Bad Boys from Boston" and "America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band". 
                As a partnership, the primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is often collectively known as the "Toxic Twins".
